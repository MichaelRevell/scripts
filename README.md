Various Scripts

1. Parse-Emails-Imap.rb - Pulls all emails off your server via Imap and creates a contact list. 
Then it stores the list in a spreadsheet.

2. Send-Emails.rb - Takes a hash of names and emails (presumably from the Parse-Emails-imap script) and 
emails them all a message, appropriately addressing each recipient.
